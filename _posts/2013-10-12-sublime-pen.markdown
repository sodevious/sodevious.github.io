With tools like [Codepen](http://codepen.io/), and [Sassmeister](http://sassmeister.com/) you can have your CSS/Sass side by side with your code. Earlier today, I [saw a tweet](https://twitter.com/jessabean/status/389102181225598976) asking for the same thing at [#sassconf](https://twitter.com/SassConf), but with [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/2). Then I was like, wait that's how my dev environment works.

See? IT'S AWESOME. I use a Mac app called [LiveReload](http://livereload.com/) + the Chrome browser extension to compile my Sass and to reload the browser on save. It works wonderfully. I don't have to leave Sublime if I want to see my changes in the browser. I also sometimes use [Divvy](http://mizage.com/divvy/) to tighten up the windows, because 13" is small, and gotta take every inch you can take yo.
