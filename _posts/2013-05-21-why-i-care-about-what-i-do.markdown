I’m sitting in some god forsaken little town in Massachusetts staring outside a window looking onto the foliage and forest beyond the glass. My eyes are drooping, as I’m running on low sleep. Javascript problems had been defeated and squashed the night before.

I’m here now because I care. I work hard because I care.

I care about the user, I care about the product. Every line of code I write, and rewrite is because it’s my responsibility to ensure that the end user has a great experience. It’s hard to care, and at the same time be told “good enough” is the finish line.

I will continue on caring, but with empathy for not just the user, but with all parties involved. It will be a journey, but it’s one I’m knee deep in.
